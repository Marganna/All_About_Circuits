A diodes are semicoductor devices[ basicly made from germanium, silicon and selenium] wich allow the positive current to flow into the 1 
direction and blocks the negative current. The operation of diode could be defined as forward biased [allowes the current], otherwise it
is reverse biased.For silicon the forward voltage is 0.7 v , for germanium - 0.3v. In silicon diodes the dark band indicates the cathode 
and the other terminal stands for the anode. Mostly diodes are used as reverse polarity protectors and trantioent protectors. Here are
some types of diodes.

1.Schottky Diode [named after the German physicist Walter H. Schottky]

Junction is formed by contacting the semiconductor material to the metal => the forward biased voltage drop is decreased to minimum.The
N type semicondutctor material acts as an antod and the metal [like platinum, chromium etc.]  as a cathode. The  schottky diode may  
reduce the switching due to the metal-semiconductor junction where the voltage drop is low => increases the diode performance => reduces 
power loss.

2. Shockley Diode

This is the first invented semiconductor device which has 4 layers.Also known as PNPN diode.The gate terminal is disconnected. There is no 
trigger inputs => the only way the diode to conduct is applying forward voltage.This diode has 2 operating options: conducting and 
non-conducting [in which state it conducts less voltage].Once it turned on, it stays on, and the reverce works the same way.
